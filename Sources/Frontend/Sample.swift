"Next!" Janet says in a harsh and yet slow voice. Tone aside, this one word is all you have been \
waiting for. In a few minutes, you’ll be on your way home!

You quickly make it to the counter. Janet is in her mid-fifties. Today, she’s wearing a red blouse \
and a navy blue polyester vest.

"Good afternoon, I would like to apply for a new pass..."

"Form?" Janet interrupts you. You slide over the sheet of paper you filled out while waiting in \
line.

Janet sips her vending machine coffee and puts the plastic cup aside. She takes your form, puts her \
reading glasses on, and turns to the computer. You catch a glimpse of a Solitaire game before she \
quickly closes it.

Janet uses her two index fingers that have long green manicure to methodically poke your data into \
the computer. The keyboard clacks are in beat with the seconds’ hand on the wall clock behind you. \
J, I, N, H, Backspace, backspace, backspace.

Janet is interrupted by that familiar Nokia ringtone you have not heard in years. She cheers up.

"Hello? Oh, hi sweetie. Yes, I am doing very well indeed… She did what?? No way! Yeah? Whoa, \
thanks for letting me know! Is the cheese at a discount too? I can’t wait to go then..."

Janet notices you have been staring at her. She reluctantly hangs up the phone. You’re back on \
track.

"ID?" she inquires.

You show her your ID card. Janet looks at the photo, glances up, takes her reading glasses off, \
and gives you a slow nod of approval. That’s it, you’re almost done! But wait, what else is she \
looking at?

You look behind you. The wall clock shows half past noon. You look back at the counter. "Out for \
lunch break." Janet is gone.
