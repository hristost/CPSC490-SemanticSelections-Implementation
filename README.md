# SemanticSelectionGUI

Main repository for my CPSC 490 Project.

Prerequisites:
- macOS 10.15 (Catalina)
- A Swift toolchain
- Python 3 installation
- [SuPar](https://github.com/yzhangcs/parser) installed globally
  ```sh
  python3 -m pip install supar
  ```
  It should be possible to run everything inside virtualenv, but I haven't
figured out how to do that yet.

## Run

1. Build and run the application:
  
    ```sh
    swift run
    ```
  
  After executing the command, a new window will open. You should be able to type text and make selections as described below.

## Making selections

### Using the mouse

- Hold down the scroll wheel button
- Move the mouse to move the selection
- Use the scroll wheel to expand / shrink selection

### Using the trackpad

- With two fingers, pinch out to expand selection, pinch in to shrink
